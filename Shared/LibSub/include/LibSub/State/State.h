	\brief A generic state code and an optional message string

	State is a simple value type to represent the high-level status of an object in a generic way, using a state code
	and an optional message string. States can be combined, enabling the state of a complex worker to simply be the
	combination of the states of its individual components. The aggregate state is the worst state code with all
	of the messages at that state code concatenated together.
